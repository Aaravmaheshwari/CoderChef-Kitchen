Add basic intuition section here. In case you want to describe the problem in more detail, add some basic figures describing the problem. For e.g. you might want to add a figure describing the graph representation for the problem.

For adding images, use the following:

```
<center>
<img src="../../Images/<Folder-Name>/<Image-Name>.png">
</center>
```

### Solution 1: <Approach Name>

##### Motivation

Describe the basic motivation for the problem here. What the core idea is behind the algorithm.

##### Algorithm

You should describe the algorithm in detail here. Use numbered lists for representing the steps of the algorithm.

##### Implementation Notes

This section is optional and you can skip it as well. In case there are special implementation caveats that you want the reader to know about, add them in this section.

##### Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity**:  Add the time complexity here, along with a small explanation.
* **Space Complexity**: Add the space complexity here, along with a small explanation.
