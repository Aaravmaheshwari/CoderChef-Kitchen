### Solution 1: < Approach Name >

#### Motivation

Describe the basic motivation for the problem here. Add what is the core idea behind the algorithm.

#### Algorithm

You should describe the algorithm in detail here. Use numbered lists for representing the steps of the algorithm.
We believe illustrations or animations are the best way to convey your thoughts and ideas. Add as many images as you can to explain the algorithm. We tend to use lucidchart.com, Pages, etc to create illustrations. Be as creative and as expressive in your articles. We always love that :smile:

#### Implementation Notes

This section is *optional* and you can skip it as well. In case there are special implementation caveats that you want the reader to know about, add them in this section.

#### Complexity Analysis

* Time Complexity: Add the time complexity here, along with a small explanation.
* Space Complexity: Add the space complexity here, along with a small explanation.
