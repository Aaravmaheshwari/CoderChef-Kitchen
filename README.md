Hey there!

```
def drink_to_code(drink):
    if drink == "green tea":
        generate_code()
```

The Coderchef Kitchen welcomes you. We're a couple of programmers who love programming and we're all about fun with Data Structures and Algorithms. 

We shy away from the notion of Coffee to Code. That's too mainstream. We're more of GreenTea to Code!

Jokes apart, you will find solutions with well defined explanations to a lot of interesting programming questions. Mostly, the questions would be from leetcode.com, but feel free to contribute as much as possible. 

Hope you like the dishes ;)
